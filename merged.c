// brute force and writes out the keyword and decoded message. Another program then reduces that
// massive data set to a smaller more feasible amount

// cifer-dict /usr/share/dict/words dict
// cifer-dict is a sub-program accompanied by cifer
//		sudo apt-get install cifer

// 2. dictionary file (dict)
